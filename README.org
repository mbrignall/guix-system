#+TITLE: My Guix-System configuration


* Guix-System

This is a initial pass at setting up Guix at a system level. It has a similar approach to my NixOS config, but requires learning Guile Scheme which I'm excited about. I wanted to use Sway as I already had lots of config files for the various features that work with it like Waybar, Fuzzel and Swaylock.

** Sway

** Discoveries

** Future Plans

*** TODO modulise the config, split the code up.

*** TODO Explore new features/differences for Guix
